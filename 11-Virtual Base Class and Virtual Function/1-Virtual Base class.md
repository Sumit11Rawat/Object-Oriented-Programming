-->>As we can see from the figure that data members/function of class A are inherited twice to class D. One through class B and second through class C. When any data / 
    function member of class A is accessed by an object of class D, ambiguity arises as to which data/function member would be called? One inherited through B or the 
    other inherited through C. This confuses compiler and it displays error.
