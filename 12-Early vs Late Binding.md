                           EARLY vs LATE BINDING

--> Binding refers to the process of converting identifiers (such as variable and performance names) into addresses.

--> Binding is done for each variable and functions. For functions, it means that matching the call with the right function definition by the compiler.
    It takes place either at compile time or at runtime.
